You have a process that handles network requests (e.g., HTTP requests) running on a two-core
Linux server. The process is not responding to requests. The uptime command returns the following
output:

    15:47  up 5 days, 12:53, 4 users, load averages: 0.13 0.10 0.12

You have neither the source code nor any user's guide for the program, and to make matters worse
the program produces no logging output. How you would determine the root cause of the failure?
