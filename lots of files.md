You want to remove all 400,000 files from a directory on a Linux server. You type

rm *

but the program outputs "Argument list too long" and exits with an error status.

(a) What version of Linux might you be using? What is the root cause? How was it solved?

(b) Show how to get around this limitation with as many of the below as possible:

  - Command line utilities (things in /bin/, /usr/bin/)
  - A bash function
  - Ruby
  - Python
  - Perl
  - C
